# Advent of Code

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles. Each year, a new set of puzzles is released, and this repository is organized to handle different years and versions.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized by year, with each year having its own directory. Inside each year's directory, you will find the solutions to the puzzles for that specific year. 

## Usage

To run the solutions, you need to have Python 3.10 installed.
First, choose a year and a day and change into the directory for that year and day. For example, if you want to run the solutions for 2022's day 1, you would run the following:

```bash
cd /YYYY/dayXX/
```

Then, you can run the solutions with the following command:

```bash
python3 solution.py < in.txt
```
